    Regarding accusations of being a clone of gogos
</h1>
<p>
    They are not. 
    They are much better and more varied than these accused gogos. 
    I remember as a kid how i went to the vending machine to get some new gogos. 
    Do you know how old I am? That was ages ago, so they must be older. 
    How else could they exist in my memories and thousands of people say the same thing. 
    We all cant be wrong. Gogos only have a better PR team than FlobbWobblers. 
    We can prove that. There are court documents showing this, but the deep state is hiding these documents.
     Why? Gogos have big money, and money write laws. 
     I for one, think that people should do there own research, the information is out there, I try to be out there.
      Just giving a lost IP that many people love a second attempt to become relevant. 
      And not just relevant, to get the recognition it deserves as one of the leading innovators in the field of collectible plastic figures.
       Flobbwobblers was our past, we cant let that be erased. 
       It formed the society we live in today.
        Think of the many achievements we have bested the last ten years. 
        Computers in pur backpockets, vaccine that can be developed in just one year. 
        Would we be there without Flobbwobblers? 
        Idk I am just one FlobbWobbler loving human, with two eyes, one mouth and one brain that did not stop asking questions.
